Everything's Reduced!
=====================

This is a collection of key reduction kernel patterns collated from other benchmarks.

## Benchmarks ##

List of benchmark kernels, and their sources.

| Reduction        | Original benchmark |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| r = a[i] * b[i]  | Dot product        |
| r += a[i] * b[i] | daxby              |
